# EDOPRO F&L list generator

This project is just a script that generates every single Time Wizard EDOPRO lflist possible.

## I just want a banlist to use on EDOPRO

Open the lflist folder, locate the list you want (they are sorted chronologically, and there's a 99% chance the one you want is in the curated folder), open it, right click on "Raw", and save it to your computer as you would save an image. Then just place it on your ``/lflist`` folder in whatever folder you installed EDOPRO in.

## I want to learn how to run the script

You need to have Python installed in order to run the script.

Open a terminal on the folder containing the script, then run ``python timewizard.py``. Once the script is done, you'll have every banlist.

## Shoutouts
